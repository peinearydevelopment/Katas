I'd never done one of these before, but work made a competition out of it. It was a lot of fun, but as the days got harder and harder, I only managed to make it to day 15 this year.
There are definitely tricks and familiarity with different algorithms that come into play with this. I didn't spend a lot of time researching those, but instead tried to figure it out on my own.
I've included the 'story' for each day in the README.MD file which I just copied and pasted from their site without any formatting.
Each folder also has the input I was given in the input.txt file and when I got the answer, I included that in the answer.txt file.
